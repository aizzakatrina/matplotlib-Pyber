# Observations

1. Urban cities have a higher percentage of drivers and rides than suburban and rural areas combined. Urban cities also generate more than half of the total fares earned between the three city types.

2. The average fare in urban cities are somewhat equal to or less than the average fares in rural and suburban cities. The average fare in suburban cities are concentrated in a range between the average fare of the other city types, while the average fare for rural cities are dispersed over an even larger range.

3. The total number of rides per city, as well as the total count of drivers per city, increases in urban areas while rural areas have less of both.
